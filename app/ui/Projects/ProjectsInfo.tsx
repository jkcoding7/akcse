          It aims to provide an platform where members can be easily updated
          with AKCSE events. It also encourages the members to contribute to the
          website to familiarize them with GitHub and web development. This
          project will ultimately create a community where members can learn to
          collaborate and improve their skill sets.

          The launch of AKCSE McGill enabled the successful development of a
          functional website, providing students with updates on events. As an
          evolving project, it creates an environment that fosters a community
          where individuals can contribute their inputs to the development of
          AKCSE McGill.

          AKCSE McGill is a website that students within the student body
          collaboratively create. The website serves as a space where
          individuals can be informed about events, intitiatives, and updates
          within AKCSE; this platform also offers hands-on experiences for
          members to gain learning opportunities through web development and
          GitHub Collaboration both within and outside the club.

        <Label className="font-normal">
          Eating disorders (EDs) are a growing public health concern, significantly impacting individuals' physical, psychological, 
          and emotional well-being. Studies show a rise in ED prevalence, particularly among younger demographics, 
          with media playing a critical role in exacerbating these disorders.

        <Label className="font-normal">
          We used different methods of preprocessing and machine learning models to test and compare results. 
          Stop word removal along with Naive Bayes classifier proved to be the most effective. 
          It achieved a maximum accuracy of 90% with the Naive Bayes classifier.

          As one of the biggest platforms for various groups to consume media, YouTube has one solution for censoring potentially harmful content: 
          manual flagging by users. Taking one step further, the AKCSE Life Science (LS) and Computer Science (CS) divisions 
          collaborated to develop a Chrome extension powered by machine learning (ML), specifically to automatically moderate YouTube 
          content and help prevent ED-triggering videos.
